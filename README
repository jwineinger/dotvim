Installing your Vim environment on another machine

Once your vim configuration is under version control, itâ€™s quite
straightforward to import your settings to any machine that has git installed.
If you followed the instructions above to put your vimrc and plugins in a
dotvim directory, then you can follow these steps to synchronise them to
another machine:

cd ~
git clone http://github.com/username/dotvim.git ~/.vim
ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
ln -s ~/.vim/gvimrc ~/.gvimrc
cd ~/.vim
git submodule update --init
